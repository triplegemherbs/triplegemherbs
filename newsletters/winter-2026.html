    <p>
      Happy New Year and welcome to the Winter 2026 Triple Gem Herbs Newsletter! This is a space where I share a featured herb,
      notes from the field, and a simple recipe for you to try. This quarter's herb is a tree with one or more species which are
      likely to be found wherever you live.

    <h2>Featured Herb: Pine</h2>

    <h3>Winter tree medicine found almost anywhere</h3>
    <p>
      Winter is officially upon us in the Northern hemisphere, and depending on where you live, the landscape may appear barren and grey,
      or may still remain lush and green. Here in Northern California, the maples and alders have lost their leaves, but we have an abundance
      of evergreen trees — coast redwoods (<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>), Douglas-fir (<em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>), Sitka spruce (<em>Picea sitchensis</em>),
      grand fir (<em>Abies grandis</em>), and various pines (<em>Pinus</em> sp.) thrive in the coastal zone year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evergreen trees such as these, known as conifers, have provided people with medicine all over the world for time immemorial.
      The word “conifer” refers to the cone — a reproductive structure that evolved before flowers. Another word for this group is “gymnosperm”:
      gymno- meaning “naked,” and -sperm meaning “seed.” In other words, the ovules and seeds are not encased in a fruit, but are borne within cones.
    </p>

    <h3>Pine as Winter Medicine</h3>
    <p>
      Species within the genus <em>Pinus</em>, or pine trees, are native to all continents and widely planted as horticultural trees,
      making them easily accessible to most. All species of pine can be used medicinally — just make sure you've identified the tree correctly
      to the genus <em>Pinus</em>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Common name:</strong> Pine</li>
      <li><strong>Botanical name:</strong> <em>Pinus</em> sp.</li>
      <li><strong>Parts used:</strong> Leaves, bark, seeds, oil/resin, pollen</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Pine leaves (pine needles) have mildly antiseptic qualities when taken internally, and are traditionally used for respiratory ailments such as
      asthma, bronchitis, and respiratory infections. The needles are rich in vitamin C and are frequently prepared as an aromatic tea for colds
      (with or without honey). You can also create an aromatic steam by adding a handful of needles to a bowl and pouring very hot water over them.
      Cover your head and the bowl with a towel (careful — steam can be hot) and inhale to clear congestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resin can be collected and extracted in oil (such as olive oil) or high-proof alcohol. The oil can be made into a salve for congestion (as a chest rub),
      sore muscles, or first aid for cuts and scrapes. The bark has astringent properties. Pine pollen and pine nuts can be used as nutritious foods.
      <strong>Note:</strong> conifers should not be used if you are pregnant.

    <p>
      This is a delicious beverage that requires minimal ingredients and is so easy to make. I love the festive red color and spice of the cinnamon.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 Tbsp dried hibiscus flowers</li>
      <li>1–2 cinnamon sticks</li>
      <li>Honey, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
      Add the hibiscus flowers and cinnamon sticks to a small saucepan with 2 cups of water. Bring to a gentle simmer, then turn off the heat and cover.
      Steep for 5–10 minutes. Strain, sweeten with honey to taste, and enjoy warm.

    <p>
      I am knee-deep in restoration work here in Northern California. The main project I am working on seeks to reduce sediment input in our watersheds —
      sediment being a major source of pollution that leads to cloudy water and degraded habitat for aquatic life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a botanist, of course, I am paying close attention to the plants on site when we do field visits: taking inventory of rare plants in need of protection,
      documenting invasive plants that degrade habitat for native species, and identifying opportunities for restoration by adding plants to stabilize the soil and prevent erosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      One site visit this fall had a spectacular number of giant sequoia trees planted onsite (<em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em>).
      These trees, native to the Sierra Nevada (not the coastal redwood forests where I call home), are the largest trees in the world.
      I wanted to share a photo of their seeds — a reminder that even the most massive and breathtaking of beings begin as something diminutive and humble.
